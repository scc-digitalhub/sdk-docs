# Artifact kinds

At the moment, we support the following kinds:

- **`artifact`**: represents a generic artifact

For each different kind, the `Artifact` object has its own subclass with different `spec` and `status` attributes.

## Artifact

The `artifact` kind indicates that the artifact is a generic artifact. It's usefull if you intend to manipulate the artifact as a file, you can in fact download/upload it.

### Artifact spec parameters
