# Artifacts

Artifacts are (binary) objects stored in one of the artifact stores of the platform, and available to every process, module and component as files (or data streams).

## Managing artifacts with SDK

Artifacts can be created and managed as *entities* with the SDK CRUD methods. This can be done directly from the package or through the `Project` object.
To manage artifacts, you need to have `digitalhub_core` layer installed.

1. In the [CRUD section](./crud.md), we will see how to create, read, update and delete artifacts.
2. In the [entity section](./entity.md), we will see what can be done with the `Artifact` object.
