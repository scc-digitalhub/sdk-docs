# Models

Models are the representation of machine learning models stored as files in the artifact store.

## Managing models with SDK

Models can be created and managed as *entities* with the SDK CRUD methods. This can be done directly from the package or through the `Project` object.
To manage models, you need to have at least `digitalhub_ml` layer installed.

1. In the [CRUD section](./crud.md), we will see how to create, read, update and delete models.
2. In the [entity section](./entity.md), we will see what can be done with the `Model` object.
