# Trigger

Triggers are the logical description of how and when jobs should be executed on the platform. A trigger controls the scheduling and execution of tasks, defining when and under what conditions they should run. This can include time-based scheduling, event-driven execution, or other triggering mechanisms.

## Managing triggers with SDK

Triggers can be created and managed as *entities* with the SDK CRUD methods. This can be done directly from the package.

1. In the [CRUD section](./crud.md), we will see how to create, read, update and delete triggers.
2. In the [methods section](./methods.md), we will see what can be done with the `Trigger` object.
3. In the [kinds section](./kinds.md), we will see what kinds are supported.
