# Runs

Runs are the representation of the execution of a task through a function.

## Managing runs with SDK

Runs are created with a `Function` or `Workflow` object through the `run` method. They can be managed as *entities*.
To manage runs, you need to have at least `digitalhub[core]` layer installed.

1. In the [methods section](./methods.md), we will see what can be done with the `Run` object.
2. In the [kinds section](./kinds.md), we will see what kinds are supported.
