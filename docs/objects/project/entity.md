# Project

A `project` represents a data and AI application and is a container for different entities (code, assets, configuration, ...) that form the application. It is the context in which you can run functions and manage models, data, and artifacts.

## Managing projects with SDK

Projects can be created and managed as *entities* with the SDK CRUD methods.
To manage projects, you need to have at least `digitalhub_core` layer installed.

1. In the [CRUD section](./crud.md), we will see how to create, read, update and delete projects.
2. In the [entity section](./entity.md), we will see what can be done with the `Project` object.
