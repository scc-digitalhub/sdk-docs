# Function

Functions are the logical description of something that the platform may execute and track for you. A function may represent code to run as a job, an ML function inference to be used as batch procedure or as a service, a data validation, etc.

## Managing functions with SDK

Functions can be created and managed as *entities* with the SDK CRUD methods. This can be done directly from the package or through the `Project` object.
To manage functions, you need to have at least `digitalhub_core` layer installed.

1. In the [CRUD section](./crud.md), we will see how to create, read, update and delete functions.
2. In the [methods section](./methods.md), we will see what can be done with the `Function` object.
3. In the [kinds section](./kinds.md), we will see what kinds are supported.
