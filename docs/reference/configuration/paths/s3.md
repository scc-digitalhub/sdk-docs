# S3 paths

S3 paths point at objects in S3 or S3-compatible storage.

## Format

- `s3://bucket/key` or `s3://bucket/prefix/` (trailing slash denotes a prefix/partition and is treated *like* a directory)

## Behavior

- The first path segment is the bucket; the remainder is the object key or prefix.
- When a prefix is provided (trailing `/`) the path represents a partition or directory-like object collection.

## Examples

```python
s3_path = "s3://my-bucket/my-key.file"
s3_partition_path = "s3://my-bucket/my-key/"
```

## Notes

- Ensure you have permissions to read the bucket. Check [S3 credentials handling](../credentials/s3.md).
