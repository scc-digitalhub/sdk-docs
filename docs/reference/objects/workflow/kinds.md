# Workflow kinds

At the moment, we support the following kinds and the related runtime:

- [**`hera`**](../../runtimes/hera/overview.md)
- [**`kfp`**](../../runtimes/kfp.md)

For each different kind, the `Workflow` object has its own subclass with different `spec` and `status` attributes.

Please see the runtime documentation for more information on the related to the various `spec` arguments.
