pip install digitalhub-runtime-container
```

## Usage overview

To execute container workloads on the platform:

1. Prepare your container image or build instructions.
2. Create a `Function` resource that references your container configuration.
3. Call `function.run()` to execute the container workload.

See [how to](how-to.md) for detailed instructions on which actions you can execute and how to configure your container workloads.
