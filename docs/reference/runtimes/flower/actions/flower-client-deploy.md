# Flower Client Deploy

The `deploy` action deploys a built Flower client container to participate in federated learning tasks. This action creates and manages the Flower client that communicates with the Flower server.

## Overview

The runtime deploys the Flower client container image to a Kubernetes cluster or remote execution environment.
The deployed client will automatically join the federated learning federation and participate in training rounds as orchestrated by the Flower server.

## Quick example with bare minimum parameters

```python
import digitalhub as dh

# Create Flower client function
f = dh.new_function(
    name="my-flower-client",
    kind="flower-client",
    image="my-registry/my-flower-client:latest",
)

# Deploy the client
run = f.run(action="deploy")
```
