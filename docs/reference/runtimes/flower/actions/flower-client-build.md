# Flower Client Build

The `build` action creates a container image for a Flower client that can participate in federated learning. This action packages the client code along with its dependencies into a deployable container image.

## Overview

The runtime builds a Docker container image containing the Flower client code.
The resulting container image can be deployed to participate in federated learning tasks. See how to [deploy the client](flower-client-deploy.md).

## Quick example with bare minimum parameters

```python
import digitalhub as dh

# Create Flower client function
f = dh.new_function(
    name="my-flower-client",
    kind="flower-client",
    base_image="some-base-image"
)

# Build the client
run = f.run(action="build", instructions=["... bash instructions ..."])
```
