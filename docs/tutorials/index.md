# Tutorials

Welcome to the Digitalhub SDK tutorials! These hands-on guides will teach you the platform's capabilities through practical, real-world examples.

## How to Use These Tutorials

Each tutorial is built around an interactive Jupyter notebook that you can import and run in your development environment:

1. **Import the notebook** - Each tutorial references a specific `.ipynb` file from the [digitalhub-tutorials repository](https://github.com/scc-digitalhub/digitalhub-tutorials)
2. **Execute step by step** - Run the notebook cells sequentially to follow along with the tutorial
3. **Learn by doing** - The notebooks contain working code examples with explanations

All notebooks are designed to be self-contained and include detailed explanations of each step in the process.
