# Using Kubernetes resources for runs

When running tasks on Kubernetes, you can specify various Kubernetes resources and configurations to optimize the deployment and performance of your tasks. The request is performed by passing a parameter usually to the `function.run()` or . `workflow.run()` methods.
The [kubernetes reference section](../reference/configuration/kubernetes/overview.md) describes the common Kubernetes parameters that can be used when deploying model serving functions.
