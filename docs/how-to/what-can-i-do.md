# What can I do?

A compact, skimmable list of common tasks you can perform with the Digitalhub SDK and where to find short examples or deeper docs.

---

## Projects

Create or get a project to group runs, functions, data, and artifacts.

[Quickstart](./quickstart.md) · [Project setup](../reference/objects/project/entity.md)

---

## Functions

Execute Python functions, serve ML models or create containerized tasks. Run them as jobs, and fetch outputs or expose them as services.

[Quickstart](./quickstart.md) · [Runtime guide](./runtime-guide.md)

---

## Dataitems & Artifacts

Register data sources as dataitems or files as artifacts. Use them as function inputs or as abstractions for data management.

[Dataitem reference](../reference/objects/dataitem/entity.md) · [Artifact reference](../reference/objects/artifact/entity.md)

---

## Runs & results

Execute functions, monitor status, wait for completion, and retrieve outputs and logs.

[Run methods](../reference/objects/run/methods.md)

---

## Workflows & orchestration

Compose tasks into workflows, schedule or trigger them, and inspect executions.

[Workflow reference](../reference/objects/workflow/entity.md) · [Hera runtime overview](../reference/runtimes/hera/overview.md)

---

## Secrets & credentials

Store credentials and secrets securely and reference them from runtimes.

[Credentials overview](../reference/configuration/credentials/overview.md)

---

## Integrations & runtimes

Run jobs on Kubernetes or locally. Choose the runtime that fits your use case.
